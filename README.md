# Imaging

An image processing program to perform image manipulation, particularly smoothing.
Implementation only accepts .pgm image files.
Image smoothing methods implemented are Gaussian smoothing, Lee filter, Median filter, and the most important method of Anisotropic Diffusion, aka Perona-Malik smoothing.

The main.c file must be changed in order to perform the wanted function, though this is simple.
